# 🟫 MineBank ⛏️💰

**MineBank** is a Minecraft-inspired desktop banking app built with **Java Swing** (using NetBeans Matisse).  
It simulates a simple bank system with account creation, transaction viewing, and balance tracking — all styled with a cozy Minecraft-themed UI.

Currently, it uses `.txt` files to store data but is being prepared for a full backend upgrade using **MySQL** and **Spring Boot** for future deployment.

Whether you're depositing emeralds or managing fake money, MineBank makes it fun and educational.

> It’s like a Minecraft village got a bank... but in Java.
